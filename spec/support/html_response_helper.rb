It was 3:30 PM and he had been on the water 15 minutes. The sky was clear with a mild southerly breeze and an estimated air temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit. The surf was 1 – 2 feet with a light chop over a sandy ocean bottom 3 – 4 feet deep and an estimated temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit. No marine mammals were observed in the area. Poukkula reported;<em>“I had just paddled back out to the surf lineup when I noticed a large dark area under the water to the right of me. Initially I thought it was some loose kelp, but as I looked closer I saw a large shark shape turn towards me. This immediately triggered a flight response and I caught the next wave in. It was not a dolphin, and much bigger than a Leopard Shark. Although I did not see it clearly, it appeared to have the usual shark features, pectoral fins at a 45 angle to body, bulbous front half of body compared the tail, and a large dorsal fin.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>

It was 4:00 PM and the sky was sunny with a light 5 – 10 mph breeze and an estimated air temperature of 76 degrees Fahrenheit. The sea was calm and 20 feet deep over a sandy bottom with a Westerly swell and an estimated temperature of 66 degrees Fahrenheit. Several pinnipeds were observed in the area. Cooper reported;<em>“We were just inside the breakwater cleaning the 12 Yellowtail that we had caught that day. We were approximately 20 minutes into the process and I happen to glance over the side of the boat. I witnessed the juvenile Great White Shark pass by the boat and grab some of the fish discarded over the side of the boat. It circled back around and headed East towards Doheny State Beach. The shark was approximately 6 feet in length and came within a range of 3 – 4 feet of the boat. It briefly turned on its side to expose its white underbelly to help facilitate it grabbing discarded Yellowtail parts.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>

It was 10:30 AM and he had been on the water 45 minutes. The sky was overcast with an estimated air temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit. The ocean was calm with 1 – 2 foot surf over a sandy bottom 5 – 6 feet deep. Estimated water temperature was 63 degrees Fahrenheit and visibility exceeded the depth as the bottom could be seen easily from the surface. No marine mammals were observed in the area. Ursini reported;<em>“I was in the line up with a fellow surfer I just met, Dave, a NYC transplant. He told me about a juvenile White Shark he has seen the last few days. About 15 minutes after that, we both observed a ‘smallish` dorsal fin protruding from the water`s surface approximately 20 yards North of us. It was stationary, as if the shark was just floating. We both caught the next wave and we`re now standing in waist to chest high water. The shark swam South and glided into a wave. The shark was now just West of us, approximately 15 to 20 yards away. A kayaker approached and photographed the shark that again was just floating. Suddenly, the shark looked in our direction and darted toward us in an approaching wave. I was eye ball to eye ball with nature`s most fierce predator and it suddenly stopped. Dave and I got out of the water. The shark was not aggressive, seemed more curious. According to Dave this appeared to be the same shark he has previously encountered and it appears to be getting less weary of humans.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>

It was 6:45 AM and he had been fishing about 20 minutes. The sky was overcast with an estimated air temperature of 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The ocean was calm with 2 – 3 foot waves and a slight undertow with an estimated water temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit. No marine mammals were observed in the area. Saksa reported;<em>“I was fishing from the shore when I observed a shark breach about 350 yards out from the beach. It turned with its snout slightly upward so I could see its white under belly. Its back was slightly darker grey than a dolphin or other type of shark. It never came back up, but I got a beautiful memory of one of the most intriguing fish of the sea.” </em> This is the location of numerous recent sightings of White Sharks.

              <p><font size="4"><strong>Redondo  Beach </strong> </font> <strong> &nbsp; &#151; <strong> &nbsp; </strong></strong> <font size="4"><strong></strong></font>On June 16, 2015 Beau Greely and an unidentified companion were  Stand Up Paddleboarding in King Harbor, Redondo Beach. It was 4:00 PM and he had been on the water 45 minutes. The water was 8 – 10 feet deep over a sandy/rocky bottom with scattered kelps. Water temperature was estimated at 67 – 68 degrees Fahrenheit with visibility greater than the depth as the bottom could be seen clearly from the surface. Greely reported;<em>“I took my SUP out for an afternoon cruise launching from the dock on the South-East side of King Harbor at 3:15 PM. I paddled toward the break wall across the jetty. As I paddled over to the glassy water right next to the break wall I saw several seals swimming by for their afternoon feed/swim. Normally there are a group of them sunning on the wall. Looking in that direction I did not see any on the rocks. It was a typical ‘June Gloom‘ day and about 73 degrees Fahrenheit when I started. Wind was minimal according to ‘Surf Report` App. There were small whitecaps along most of the jetty, and it was glassy smooth from the break wall to 75 yards away from the wall. When I got to the glassy water I was talking to another SUP friend. As we talked I noticed about 10 seals swim to the wall and they proceeded to get out of the water hopping onto the rocks out of ‘Harms Way.` I commented to my friend that I found it unusual for that many seals to assemble within a two minute span. About that time 4:05 I noticed something jump out of the water, my first thought before I got my head turned was that it was a seal. I turned around quick enough to see what appeared to be a big fish b/c of the size of the Sharks tail. Straight away I told my buddy that it looked like a shark. I was scoping the water hoping to see it as water visibility in that area was a minimum of 10 feet from my vantage point on top of the water. As I looked down I saw what appeared to be a 7&frac12; – 8 foot shark. Closely viewing the shark it was clear that it was a juvenile Great White Shark. It was a dark grey and when it swam by me it didn`t give any notice of me or my friend. I immediately paddled in the direction he looked to be going. I was going very slowly so there was no splash from my paddle. As I looked up, about 5 yards in front of me, I saw it whip around explosively with the thrust from his tale. I saw a small bit of white on its lower front girth. At that point I had absolutely no doubt what kind of shark we were fortunate enough to see. Its behavior for the short time I saw it was confused, frantic and lost. I don`t know of its whereabouts after my second sighting but it was heading for the harbor entrance/exit. We were never in danger and it showed no Interest in us at all. It was great to see it swimming so freely and in no danger whatsoever. Pretty sweet little Tuesday.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. <em></em></p>

He shouted that he saw another fin and thought it might be another shark, but a paddleboarder a few yards away stated that it was definitely one shark and that it was ‘girthy`. I was half-way to shore, but noticed that my friend still wasn`t paddling in. After another minute or so, he finally started paddling for the next wave. Once on shore he mentioned that the shark had swum underneath him and was in between him and the shore, hence his hesitation to paddle in. He also mentioned that it seemed like it was 7 feet long and that the previous day there had been a helicopter cruising the shoreline announcing that there was a shark in the water and asking people to get out of the water. We walked up the beach about 100 feet and after a few minutes paddled out next to the paddleboarder and his family and friends.

It was 10:00 AM and they had been on the water about 2 hours. The sky was clear with a very mild breeze and an estimated air temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The ocean was calm over a sandy flat bottom 60 feet deep with 20 plus feet of visibility and an estimated temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit. Birds were diving on schools of baitfish at the surface. They had caught 2 rockfish that were released. No marine mammals were observed in the area. Davault reported;<em>“</em><em>My buddy Sean&nbsp;and I launched from the Capitola wharf by 8am in pursuit of an early season Halibut. The conditions were remarkably calm.&nbsp; A slight breeze first thing in the morning quickly gave way to warm morning sunshine. We slowly trolled bounce ball rigs out to where birds could be seen working bait balls which were boiling against the surface. We had just adjusted our trajectory so as to troll parallel to the shore line, more or less in line with the Cement Ship. Sean was at my left side, about 25 feet away keeping similar pace. I was focused on my rod, feeling the weight skip across the bottom in 60 feet of water as we trolled in silence. All at once there was a firm blow to the front of my kayak, sufficient to lift the bow up out of the water. At that same instant, on my left side, the water exploded as a shark breached through the surface. The top half of its back cleared out of the water. I could clearly see the head, dorsal fin and quite a long portion of its back as it made reentry back into the water. The tail was the last thing I saw, pumping back and forth several times, it kicked up a considerable volume of water and spray into the air, and my face.&nbsp; The shark tore back into the foamy frothy water it had just stirred up. Then it was silent, just as it was one moment ago. The entire encounter lasted all of one second. The shark had already reentered the water and was gone by the time my brain was even able to compute what had just happened. I think it hit my kayak with its back and or dorsal fin, not mouth. Perhaps a last minute aborted attack resulting in more of a collision than an full on attack. We rafted up for about 30 minutes but the shark did not return.</em><em>” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>

The friend I came with had dismissed the fin I saw saying it was probably an Orca. When I approached a ranger about Orcas in the area, he said they aren`t present in this area. An hour later a man who was fishing 100 yards North said he saw something too large to be a Dolphin and but too fast to be a Whale also making a lot of commotion in the area. After reviewing photographs of Orca and White Shark dorsal fins I am positive it was not an Orca.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>

It was 3:15 PM and he had been on the water 25 minutes. The sky was clear with a mild breeze and an estimated air temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit. The water was calm over a sandy ocean bottom 18 feet deep, with 40 feet of underwater visibility and an estimated temperature of 63 degrees Fahrenheit. There were short statured kelps growing from the breakwater rocks and more than 25 pinnipeds scattered on the breakwater rocks with a few in the water. Grant reported;<em>“I launched at Baby Beach and was paddling my bright red 14 foot race Stand Up Paddle Board along the inside of the Dana Point Breakwater, about 50 yards from the light at the end of it where the Sea Lions congregate. The water was clear and calm. I saw a dark shape about two feet beneath the surface swimming directly toward me, head on. I knew immediately that it was a shark, and not a Sea Lion. I am a lifelong surfer; fisherman, free diver and professional mariner, and I have seen many species of sharks before, in many oceans. I was wearing polarized sunglasses and could see this shark perfectly. At the last moment the shark noticed me and rolled to its left side and gave a kick to get beneath my board. I saw its profile as it swam about 4 feet beneath my board. It had a dark grey topside which transitioned to a white underbelly; the tail fin was oversized. I estimated that the shark was 8 feet long, as it was more than half the length of my paddle board. As it swam under and about 20 feet behind me, I could clearly see it turn to the right and begin to make a slow circle, and it swam under me again, and then did so a second time. The body was broad, and the pectoral and dorsal fins also seemed oversized. I estimate its weight to be about 250 lbs. There is no doubt in my mind that it was a juvenile Great White Shark. After the second circle it made of me, it continued on its original course into the harbor, along the breakwater, about 2 feet beneath the surface. That was the last I saw of it, though I paddled around the area for another 30 minutes looking for it. I alerted all paddle boarders and kayakers that I saw on my way back to Baby Beach.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>

The evidence is a seal that was found Thursday, February 19, on a beach near Ocean Shores, neatly bitten in half. Ocean Shores is located about 20 miles north of the Long Beach Peninsula`s northern tip in Grays County. A necropsy was performed by the department in consultation with a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shark expert in California. They determined on Tuesday the likely predator was a Great White Shark. Judging by the spacing of the bite marks it is about 18 feet long. The seal found  with its hindquarters missing was a female that weighed more than 200 pounds. Its stomach was filled with smelt, indicating she had been recently attacked close to shore. Great White Sharks appear off the Washington coast, as they do elsewhere around the world. Only two shark attacks on humans have been documented in Washington — one in the 1830s and one in 1989. The attacks weren`t fatal, but the 1989 incident did occur in Grays Harbor. As a precaution the department has notified other agencies of the presence of the Great White Shark, including the Coast Guard, state parks, and local governments and tribes on the coast. Another seal found dead near Ocean Shores on Saturday also was examined, but it was determined it likely died as a result of being entangled in a fishing net. It did not have bite marks.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>

              <p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Pacific Coast Shark Attacks During 2014 </strong></font></p>
              <p>There were 6 authenticated unprovoked shark attacks on humans reported from the Pacific Coast of North America during 2014. All of the attacks were recorded from California. The attacks were distributed in the following months; July (1), October (4) and December (1). Activities of the victims were; 3 Surfing, 2 Kayaking, and 1 Outrigger. The Great White Shark, <em>Carcharodon carcharias, </em> was positively identified or highly suspect in all 6 unprovoked attacks. Only two individual`s sustained physical injury, both were surfing. These incidents will be treated in greater detail in the Year-End SRC Newsletter. The boat incident in November in Central California is not considered in this analysis due to the activity of fishing, which might have attracted the shark to the vessel. </p>
              <p>The publication <em>“Shark Attacks of the Twentieth Century” </em> authenticated 108 unprovoked shark attacks from the Pacific Coast between 1900 and 1999. The Great White Shark was implicated in 94 (87%) of the 108 confirmed attacks with an annual average of slightly more than one shark attack per year. The 6 cases reported for 2014 brings the total number of unprovoked shark attacks occurring along the&nbsp;Pacific Coast during the 21 st Century to 83. This is <em>‘three times` </em> the Twentieth Century annual average of slightly more than 2 shark attack per year during the period 1950 – 1999. The Great White Shark was positively identified or highly suspect in 73 (88%) of the 83 attacks recorded during the 21st Century. From 2000 to the present, 42 (51%) of the 83 confirmed attacks occurred during the three&nbsp;month period of&nbsp;August (12), September (9), and October (21).&nbsp;There have been 191 authenticated unprovoked shark attacks reported from the Pacific Coast of North America from&nbsp;1900&nbsp;to 2014. The Great White Shark was positively identified or highly suspect in 167 (87%) of the 191 cases. There were 8 fatal shark attacks confirmed from 1900 to 1999 and 5 fatal attacks reported from 2000 to 2013. The 13 fatal attacks represent 7% of the 191 total cases.</p>
              <p>Victim activity for the 83 shark attacks reported from the Pacific Coast since 2000 are distributed in the following ocean user groups; surfers 54 (65%) of the documented attacks, with 6 swimmers (7%), 11 kayakers (13%), 4 divers (5%), 4 paddle boarders (5%), 1 windsurfer (1%), 1 fishing (1%), 1 outrigger (1%) and 1 boogie boarder (1%). The number of shark-bitten stranded marine mammals reported in 2014 was slightly less than the prior year, especially in Santa Barbara County. This artifact might not necessarily be the result of a decrease in the number of sharks or pinnipeds but&nbsp;rather fewer individuals reporting these events to recognized organizations or individuals.&nbsp;The Shark Research Committee will continue to closely monitor these activities. </p>

              <p><font size="4"><strong>Humboldt North Jetty </strong> </font> <strong> &nbsp; &#151; <strong> &nbsp; </strong></strong> <font size="4"><strong></strong></font>On January 14, 2015 Andrew Goff of the Lost Coast Outpost described the following;<em>“</em><em>Attached to a personal dive float and with a 70cm speargun in hand, 23-year-old Martin Magneson was free diving on the channel side of the jetty about 50 yards out from where the rocks transition to ‘dolos` (</em><em>a concrete block in a complex geometric shape weighing up to 20 tons, used in great numbers to protect harbor walls from erosive)</em><em>. Conditions were good; he`d snagged a few fish, which he`d clipped to a rope attached to his float that also tethered his gun, in case he dropped it. Magneson said underwater visibility was pretty good for Humboldt — about 20 feet. As he was about to surface, he glanced out toward the ocean and his peripheral vision caught a grayish/whitish object in the distance. At first he thought it was a harbor seal, as he`d already seen a couple earlier. Then he figured it out,‘It was a great white. I couldn`t mistake it,` Magneson told LoCO&nbsp; via phone, estimating the shark was nearly 15 feet. ‘Its mouth was as big as my torso, from my waistline to the middle of my neck.`&nbsp;At first, Magneson said, the shark wasn`t aggressive — ‘It was just there to investigate` — and watched him from a distance. He wonders if maybe it had been drawn by his day`s catch, still attached to his float nearby.&nbsp;Then it quickly came closer. As the shark neared, Magneson pointed his speargun toward it but resisted firing — thinking it might be his last line of defense. When the shark was close enough he poked at it. ‘It felt like a solid object,` he said, adding that his prodding didn`t really phase it. Magneson pulled the trigger. At this point the shark was close enough to engulf most of the speargun in its mouth. Magneson released his grip when he felt the animal bite down. After untangling the rope attached to the gun from his weight belt, Magneson said he then pushed against the shark to get away and was struck by its pectoral fin. Aided by his three-foot fins, Magneson swam as fast as he could toward the jetty.&nbsp; ‘I don`t know how long it took,` Magneson said about his brief journey to the rocks. ‘It felt like it took forever.` Once he reached safety, he looked back toward his float and said it was briefly moving, as though the shark was still somehow attached. Then the movement stopped. He contacted the Coast Guard to let them know his equipment was in the water. The Coast Guard pulled in his equipment during a training session later that night. Unfortunately his speargun is no more — only the handle and trigger portion, sporting a few bite marks, was still attached to the buoy when it was snagged.‘The main thing I learned is to be a lot more careful,` Magneson said, noting he probably should not have been diving alone where he was.”&nbsp; </em>Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee.</p>

He said it was just under the surface so none of the fins were visible. He said it was not the usual 6 foot juveniles; this one had some width and weight to it.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee.  </p>

              <p><font size="4"><strong>Ventura </strong> </font> <strong> &nbsp; &#151; <strong> &nbsp; </strong></strong> <font size="4"><strong></strong></font>On January 10, 2015 Maverick Carey and his friend Trent Stevens were about 400 yards from shore at Surfers Point, Ventura, located near C Street and sometimes referred to as Surfers Point. It was 3:00 PM and they had been on the water about one hour. The sky was cloudy with occasional light rain and an off shore ESE 5 – 10 mph breeze with an estimated air temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit. There were an additional 50 – 60 surfers in the area with an estimated water temperature in the low 60s Fahrenheit. No marine mammals were observed in the area. Carey reported;<em>“Trent and I were sitting in the lineup with my friend waiting for the next set when we saw a Great White Shark breach completely out of the water, about 10 – 12 feet into the air. The shark was 400 – 500 yards further out and was at least 10 feet in length with a defined line of demarcation between the upper dorsal dark color and the white belly. We did not see the shark breach again.” </em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>
